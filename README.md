# YoutubeDownloader
Download videos from youtube with out any ads!


The website could work without running the server and thats becuse it uses an open API I created and if it stop working you will need to change the url to your own server


## To set up the server simple run
```bash
npm install
```

thats will download all the packages needed to run the server

## To start the server run
```bash
npm start
```
